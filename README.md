## Overview
VHDL implementation and testbench for a basic 2-input AND gate. Includes source code and testbench files for simulation and synthesis practice using ModelSim and VS Code.

## Main Files
- `AND_GATE.vhd`: VHDL code implementing the AND gate entity and architecture.
- `AND_GATE_tb.vhd`: Testbench to simulate the AND gate inputs and observe output behavior.

## Requirements
- ModelSim (Intel FPGA Edition recommended) for simulation.
- VS Code (or any text editor) for editing and compiling VHDL code.
- VHDL compiler tools (e.g., `vcom`) properly installed and added to system PATH.

## How to Compile and Simulate
**1- Compile VHDL Files:** In the ModelSim GUI, you can compile manually, go to `Compile` -> `Compile..` -> and then select the required file and its testbench.
Or using Modelsim command line:
```pgsql 
vlib work
vmap work ./work
vcom AND_GATE.vhd
vcom AND_GATE_tb.vhd
```

**2- Simulate Testbench:**
```pgsql 
vsim work.AND_GATE_tb
add wave *
run 40 ns
```
**3- View waveforms:**
Use the ModelSim waveform viewer to inspect signal transitions and verify AND gate functionality.
